## Configuration

### Domain Management

### Detection Patterns

The plugin automatically detects:

- Random character usernames: `xjk8m9p2`, `aqwerty123`
- Pattern-based names: `user123`, `name-456`
- Missing display names or profiles
- Bulk registrations from same domains
- Inactive accounts with no engagement

### WooCommerce Settings

When WooCommerce is active:

- Users with completed orders are protected by default
- Shopping cart icon (üõí) indicates customers
- "Force Delete" option available for override
- Order status considered in risk scoring

## Technical Details

### Database Impact

- Uses WordPress transients for caching (24-hour expiration)
- No custom database tables created
- Minimal database footprint
- Automatic cache cleanup on deactivation

### Performance Considerations

- Optimized database queries with proper indexing
